[Metamath](https://us.metamath.org/) implementation in [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/)

exercise for [Beautiful Racket](https://beautifulracket.com)

Metamath is a [language](https://us.metamath.org/downloads/metamath.pdf) for formal mathematical proofs.

Here we have a partial implementation:
 - distinct variables are not checked
 - the language is not quite metamath, but a language between metamath and lisp.
